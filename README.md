# Tamagotchi

Since before starting to learn coding, I wanted to build my own Tamagotchi. 
Four months in, I'm giving this a try on a quiet week-end.

After a couple hours, it looked like this:

The chicken is from [Stardew Valley](https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/). I'll eventually use my own sprite but it's been a pleasure to work with those in the meantime. Play Stardew Valley! It's a great game!

Then we had to make a personal project for out last checkpoint so we could show off when we could do.

## Stack

Front : React, Sass.
Back : Express, Node.
Project done from scratch.
